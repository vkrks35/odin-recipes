        <h2>About</h2>
        <p> Vaishu's Recipe List contains a bunch of recipe's that I want to try out this summer! The goal is to find
            recipes that are <strong>simple,</strong> <strong>healthy,</strong> and <strong>delicious!</strong>
        </p>
        <p> Although this will start as a rough list of interesting recipes, the goal is to eventually update this website's
            functionality by allowing it to search through websites and pull out ingredients, create grocery lists, and help
            me with meal prepping!
        </p>
        <p> But this might take me a while to figure out... so stick around for updated features, and tasty treats!</p>
        <p> Navigate through the pages to find recipes</p>
